# PhysiLearn+: Optimizing Feedback Mechanisms in Physics Interactive Teaching Using Information Theory

## Overview

Modern physics education faces challenges in fostering student engagement, conceptual understanding, and skill transfer, especially in traditional lecture-based settings. This project introduces a **Cognitive-Driven Engagement Strategy (CDES)** integrated with an **Interactive Physics Learning Framework (IPLF)** to enhance interactive teaching using information theory.

By employing adaptive content delivery, experimental simulations, and collaborative feedback systems, this approach provides personalized, hands-on, and peer-supported learning experiences. Dynamic instructional adjustments, real-time feedback loops, and group-based problem-solving mechanisms are at the core of this framework.

## Key Features

- **Cognitive-Driven Engagement Strategy (CDES)**: Dynamically adjusts instructional complexity based on cognitive load and student responses.
- **Interactive Physics Learning Framework (IPLF)**: Integrates simulations, adaptive assessments, and real-time feedback mechanisms.
- **Adaptive Feedback Mechanisms**: Uses information theory principles to optimize feedback loops and improve conceptual understanding.
- **Collaborative Learning Support**: Encourages group-based problem-solving and peer discussions to enhance engagement.
- **Experimental Evaluation**: Demonstrates improvements in student retention, problem-solving skills, and conceptual clarity.
